## Professional Experience 

#### Dec 22 - Oct 24 

##### Associate,
##### Bryden Wood, London, UK

*Led geospatial team of analysts and engineers in delivering algorithmic and geospatial solutions across multiple sectors. Key projects:* 

- **Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis** for life science laboratories. Generalizing 30% of the client’s design portfolio reducing real estate and designing costs. o Discrete event simulation tool to optimize production in pharmaceutical sites. An end to end product, allowing users to configure a P&ID, compute mass flow, and run multiple simulations. 
- **Global and detailed routing for pipeline networks on LNG sites**. Produce dynamic solutions on new or existing sites, reducing construction cost by 15% increasing operational area, while respecting design guides and principles for optimum flows. 
- **Location-allocation modelling**  framework for health care facilities improving accessibility and service distribution across a US state region. 
- **Segmenting remote sensing imagery**, to identify existing buildings on power plants proximity. [[SIDE-NOTE: Test side note here]]
- **Multi criteria investment planning model** for nuclear power plants, allowing users to evaluate socioeconomic and environmental risks and compare different investment strategies.
- **Earthwork optimization** tool to reduce construction costs via optimal transport algorithms and auto mass haul computations, reducing the process time of the data from days to a few minutes. 
- **Market assessment** of the petroleum sector, providing insights on existing infrastructure, power generation capabilities, industry dependencies, growth trends, and regional feasibility using open source spatial data and aerial imaging.






#### Sep 20- Dec 22 

##### Senior Spatial Data Scientist, 
##### Bryden Wood, London, UK

 *Developed algorithms and applications for designing & planning automation (highways, railway, data centers), data analysis and interactive visualizations (web, VR) of spatial information. Highly involved in the research and development of the following projects*

- **Point Cloud Semantic-Segmentation and Cable Routing**, to produce new cable layouts in a constrained environment of underground tunnels with preexisting equipment and various obstacles. 
- **Multi-criteria Optimization** with Genetic Algorithms (NSGA2) to identify optimum building layouts for critical infrastructures, that minimize the cost of construction by 20% and shrinks planning phase time to a few hours. 
- **Transportation network optimization**- Cycling and pedestrian network planning automation platform that explores interventions in existing urban networks. The designed algorithm maximizes the accessibility between specific nodes and minimizes the burden to the traffic due to the intervention by selecting the most suitable road segments.[[SIDE-NOTE: Another test here to test div]]



#### Sep 18- Sep 20 

##### Spatial Data Scientist, 
##### Bryden Wood, London, UK

- **Spatio-Temporal analysis for car collision data**, to forecast significant clusters of high-risk areas. Regression models to identify relation between road conditions (light, weather) and number of collisions.
- **Railway alignment optimization,** [a least-cost pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_geometry) [application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-cost_routing) to optimize railway alignments, creating multiple alignment scenarios to increase train speeds and reduce construction costs by reusing existing infrastructure. Conducted physics simulations to model achievable speed limits, improving alignment efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- **Delta encoding system**, to keep track of actions in our production database and provide the ability to restore previous information by minimizing the data storage footprint of the system by 60%. Using Flask, Celery and Redis.
- **Data driven VR application**, visualizing real-time and historical spatial data across motorway networks. Enhanced user experience with a custom hierarchical graph-based navigation and caching system to boost application performance and responsiveness.
- **Modular Frameworks and ETL Pipeline Implementation**, established and supported modular frameworks and ETL pipelines to streamline data processing workflows, significantly improving team productivity and efficiency. 

**Technologies used** : *Python (GDAL,GeoPandas,NetworkX,SimPy,SciPy, Flask, Celery), Redis, MongoDB, JavaScript (D3, ThreeJS), Unity (C#)*
