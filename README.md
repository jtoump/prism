# PRISM


PRISM is a personal project I had in WIP for a few years. Here is the repo where I will try to push updates as much as possible. The idea behind it is to set a digital garden type of a website. For now the immediate goals is to set up a tech stack that can transform simple markdown docs to html pages in the website.
